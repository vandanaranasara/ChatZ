 Introduction  
Following the progress outlined in Interim Report I, this report details the work 
accomplished during Weeks 8 to 15 of the internship at Cuztomise Softech Pvt. Ltd. 
The primary objective during this phase was to enhance and finalize the Speech 
Recognition -based Support Call Analysis System. Focus areas included refining the 
transcription process using the Whisper model, improving data storage through SQL 
Server integration, building a user -friendly Flask -based dashboard, and implementing 
client -wise summary generation.  Significant efforts were dedicated to optimizing 
audio preprocessing, handling edge cases, and enhancing user interface components 
for better usability. The system was further extended to support real -time status 
tracking, keyword -based analytics, and efficient retrieval of call data. This phase 
marked the transition from development to deployment readiness, ensuring the 
solution was robust, scalable, and ready for practical implementation in client 
environments.   
 
 
Reporting Period  
This report covers the progres s made during weeks 8 -15 of the internship. The work 
was structured into various phases, ensuring timely completion of milestones.

 Accomplishments and Work Performed  
Week 8: Bug Fixes and Backend Optimization  
• Addressed minor bugs in the transcription output format (extra white spaces, 
punctuation errors).  
• Implemented logging to track errors during Whisper model execution.  
• Improved the API response format to return status codes and clear messages 
for each audio file.  
Week 9: Integration of SQL Server and API Development  
• Established a secure connection between the Flask app and SQL Server.  
• Created API endpoints for inserting and retrieving transcription data using 
RESTful services.  
• Added functionality to handle edge cases like duplicate file uploads or empty 
audio files.  
Week 10: Frontend UI Enhancements using Flask and HTML/CSS  
• Designed a clean web dashboard to visualize audio files, transcription output, 
and summary reports.  
• Implemented filtering and search functionality based on client name, date, and 
keywords.  
• Added table views for status tracking of each support call (transcribed, 
pending, error).  
Week 11: Audio Preprocessing Improvements  
• Added logic to trim silent segments from audio files before transcription.  
• Normalized audio volume to enhance transcription accuracy.  
• Improved error handling for corrupted or incompatible audio formats.  
Week 12: Summary Generation and Keyword Analysis  
• Integrated a summary generator to extract highlights from each transcription.  
• Used keyword matching techniques to identify key concerns in support calls 
(e.g., "not working", "payment issue").  
• Stored summaries in the database and linked them to respective clients in the 
dashboard.  
Week 13: Dashboard Finalization and Client Analytics  
• Finalized dashboard layout with client -wise summaries and audio file 
statistics.  Support Call Analysis   2024 -2025

 • Implemented visual indicators (color codes) for transcription status and error 
logs.  
• Created a section for client insights showing recurring issues, call durations, 
and word frequency.  
Week 14: Testing, Debugging, and Code Optimization  
• Conducted end -to-end testing of the portal including file upload, transcription, 
database logging, and UI updates.  
• Fixed UI responsiveness issues on smaller screens.  
• Refactored code for better modularity and maintainability.  
Week 15: Documentation and Final Presentation Preparation  
• Documented the entire project structure including model usage, backend API 
structure, database schema, and frontend logic.  
• Prepared the final presentation slides for showcasing project flow, features, 
and real -world impact.  
• Collected feedback from mentors and incorporated final suggestions for 
improvement.

Academic Relevance  
The second half of the internship provided a deeper practical application of concepts 
learned during my academic coursework, especially in areas such as machine 
learning, natural language processing, full -stack development, and database 
management systems. The integration of OpenAI’s Whisper model into a real -world 
application reinforced my understanding of deep learning and audio signal processing, 
which were covered in courses on artificial intelligence and deep learning.  
The design and development of the Flask -based web application aligned with 
concepts from web technologies and software engineering, while working with SQL 
Server and API integration reflected the principles of database systems and backend 
development. Additionally, knowledge from data structures, Python programming, 
and system design was essential in building scalable and efficient modules. This 
experience bridged the gap between theory and practice, providing hands -on exposure 
to industry -standard tools and frameworks.  
 
 
Conclusion  
The completion of the internship at Cuztomise Softech Pvt. Ltd. has been a valuable 
and enriching experience. The final weeks of the internship focused on refining and 
deploying the Speech Recognition -based Support Call Analysis System. This 
involved building a robust pipeline from audio preprocessing to transcription using 
the Whisper model, storing results in SQL Server, and presenting client -wise insights 
via a responsive Flask dashboard.  Throughout the internship, I enhanced both my 
technical and problem -solving skills while working on real -world business challenges. 
The project not only improved my understanding of speech recognition and full -stack 
development but also exposed me to collaborative development, debugging, and 
deployment practices. This hands -on experience will greatly benefit my future 
academic and professional pursuits in the field of software development and artificial 
intelligence.
